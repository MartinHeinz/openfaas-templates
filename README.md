# OpenFaaS Templates
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MartinHeinz/openfaas-templates.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MartinHeinz/openfaas-templates)

This repository is used both for development of _OpenFaaS_ templates and well as a _OpenFaaS Template Store_.

## Related Projects/Work
_OpenFaaS_ functions created using templates in this repository can be found in following repository - <https://github.com/MartinHeinz/openfaas-functions>.

## Usage

Before deploying functions, the Docker image needs to first be push to remote registry repository, this repository is specified using `PREFIX` variable in `Taskfile.yml`. You need to change its value to your _Docker Hub_ username.

- **Verify**:

    You can verify that all templates work by running:
    ```bash
    task verify
    ```
    This will build all templates in `template` directory. Ideally test should be included in Docker build, so that test don't need to be ran separately.

- **Build**:

    You can build the Docker image of the template using:
    ```bash
    task build FUNC=golang-mod
    ```
    
- **Run**:

    You can run template by building and running function created from it:
    ```bash
    task run FUNC=golang-mod
    ```
    The function is ran in Docker container on local accessible on port _8081_.
        
- **Debug**:

    You can debug template by building and running function created from it and attaching to its `watchdog` process logs:
    ```bash
    task debug FUNC=golang-mod
    ```
    
    When the function is running you can hit it with _cURL_:
    ```bash
    curl -vvv --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
              --request POST \
              --data '{"key":"value"}' \
              127.0.0.1:8081
    ```
        
    You might also want to change timeouts of the function when debugging (`template.yml`):
        
    ```yaml
    functions:
        func_name:
          ...
          environment:
              read_timeout: 20
              write_timeout: 20
    ```
    
- **Clean**:

    To remove artifacts created during build you can run:
    ```bash
    task clean
    ```

## Using Local Docker Images

Images need to be pushed to remote registry, because _OpenFaaS_ doesn't recognize local repositories. That's why, you need to specify prefix, which is a username + repository in remote registry.

If you don't want to push images, then you can use `helm` and pass it `openfaasImagePullPolicy` and `faasnetesd.imagePullPolicy` parameters to use local docker images:

```shell
helm upgrade openfaas chart/openfaas --install \
  --set "faasnetesd.imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent" \
  --set "openfaasImagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent" \
  --namespace openfaas  \
  --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \
  --set operator.create=true
```

## Create New Template

How you create new templates depends on language you use, therefore please refer to guide at <https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/blob/master/guide/TEMPLATE.md>


For the _Golang_ based templates please use _Golang_ module system.
 
You can use `./template/golang-mod` as a base or example.
 
Before building image, you first need to download all dependencies with `go mod tidy`.

## Troubleshooting Functions

Apart from `task debug` you can also use following commands for troubleshooting:

- View functions and their logs:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get deploy -n openfaas-fn
    NAME             READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE    AGE
    <FUNCTION_NAME>   0/1       1            0           11m
    nodeinfo          1/1       1            1           7h3m
    
    kubectl logs -n openfaas-fn deploy/<FUNCTION_ANME>
    ```

- See if function failed to start:

    ```shell
    kubectl describe -n openfaas-fn deploy/<FUNCTION_NAME>
    ```
